  "summary": "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its code readability, dynamic typing, and support for multiple programming paradigms. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python has gained widespread use, particularly in machine learning and as an introductory programming language. It consistently ranks among the top ten most popular programming languages.",
